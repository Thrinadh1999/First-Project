								<br>
								<p>
									Thank you for subscribing to Jobs Portal ("Services"). The
									Services are provided by Pranava EET LLP ("Pranava EET"), located at 2-3-33,
									Co-Operative Bank Colony, Nagole, Hyderabad 500068, Telangana, India.
								</p>
								<p>
									By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please go through
									them carefully.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Using our Services</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.
								</p>
								<p>
									Don't misuse our Services. For example, don't interfere with our Services
									or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the
									instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by
									law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and
									regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do
									not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected
									misconduct/fraud.
								</p>
								<p>
									Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property
									rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content
									from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are
									otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use
									any branding or logos used in our Services. You are not permitted to
									remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our
									Services.
								</p>
								<p>
									If we detect suspicious activity, we may review content to determine
									whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove content
									that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does
									not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don't assume that we
									do.
								</p>
								<p>
									In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service
									announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt
									out of some of those communications.
								</p>
								<p>
									Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such
									Services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic
									or safety laws.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Your Jobs Portal Account</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									You will need a Jobs Portal Account in order to use some of our
									Services. A Jobs Portal Account may be assigned to you by an
									administrator, such as your employer. Your administrator is authorized to
									disable your account.
								</p>
								<p>
									To protect your Jobs Portal Account, keep your password
									confidential. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or
									through your Jobs Portal Account. Try not to reuse your 
									Jobs Portal Account password on third-party applications. If you learn
									of any unauthorized use of your password or Jobs Portal Account,
									please contact us, and disable your account immediately.
									Our administrator can then pursue the issue or contact us for assistance.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Privacy </strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Pranava EET's privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and
									protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you
									agree that Jobs Portal can use such data in accordance with our
									privacy policies.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Your Content in our Services</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive
									content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you
									hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.
								</p>
								<p>
									You can find more information about how Pranava EET uses and stores content in
									the privacy policy. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our
									Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to
									you.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>About Software in our Services</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software
									may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is
									available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.
								</p>
								<p>
									Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services
									may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to
									you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly
									override some of these terms.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Modifying and Terminating our Services</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove
									functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service
									altogether.
								</p>
								<p>
									You can stop using our Services at any time, although we'll be sorry to see
									you go. Pranava EET may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create
									new limits to our Services at any time.
								</p>
								<p>
									We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data
									is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we
									will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out
									of that Service.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and
									care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain
									things that we don't promise about our Services.
								</p>
								<p>
									Other than as expressly set out in these terms or additional terms, neither
									Pranava EET nor its suppliers or distributors make any specific promises about
									the Services. For example, we don't make any commitments about the content
									within the Services, the specific functions of the Services, or their
									reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs. We provide the
									Services "as is". To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all
									warranties.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Liability for our Services</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									When permitted by law, Pranava EET will not be responsible for lost profits,
									revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential,
									exemplary, or punitive damages.
								</p>
								<p>
									To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of Pranava EET for any
									claims under these terms, including for any implied warranties, is limited
									to the amount you paid us to use the Services (or, if we choose, to
									supplying you the Services again).
								</p>
								<p>
									In all cases, Pranava EET will not be liable for any loss or damage that is not
									reasonably foreseeable.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Business uses of our Services</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business
									accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Pranava EET and its
									officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from
									or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms,
									including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages,
									suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>About these Terms</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service
									to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You
									should look at the terms regularly. We'll post notice of modifications to
									these terms on this page. We'll post notice of modified additional terms in
									the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will
									become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted.
									However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for
									legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the
									modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that
									Service.
								</p>
								<p>
									If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the
									additional terms will control for that conflict.
								</p>
								<p>
									These terms control the relationship between Pranava EET and you. They do not
									create any third-party beneficiary rights.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you do not comply with these terms, and we don't take action right away,
									this doesn't mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such
									as taking action in the future).
								</p>
								<p>
									For information about how to contact Pranava EET, please visit our contact
									page.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Waiver</strong>
								</p>				
								<p>No provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to be waived
									and no breach excused, unless such waiver or consent shall be in
									writing and signed by Pranava EET. Any consent by Pranava EET to, 
									or a waiver by Pranava EET of any breach by
									you, whether expressed or implied, shall not constitute consent to,
									waiver of, or excuse for any other different or subsequent breach.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p><strong>BY CONTINUING TO USE OUR SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT 
								YOU HAVE READ THESE TERMS OF USE AND AGREE TO ALL OF THE
									PROVISIONS CONTAINED ABOVE.</strong></p>
